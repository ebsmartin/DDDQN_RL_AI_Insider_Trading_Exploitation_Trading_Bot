# Exploiting Insider Trading: A Deep Learning Approach
Utilizing a Double Dueling Deep Q Reinforcement Based Trading Agent-Based Approach

     *THIS IS A CURRENT WORK IN PROGRESS*

## Introduction

In the complex landscape of financial markets, insider trading activities present a unique window of opportunity for predictive analytics. Our project seeks to leverage SEC Form 4 filings, which disclose insider trading activities, to predict stock price movements and unveil profitable trading signals. Through advanced machine learning techniques and deep learning models, we aim to democratize financial data and provide equal footing for all investors.

## Keywords

- Big Data
- Time Series Forecasting
- Python
- Machine Learning
- Data Analysis
- Stock Market Prediction

## Project Overview

This endeavor explores the realm of financial markets with a focus on insider trading disclosed through SEC Form 4 filings. By applying time-series analysis and deep learning, specifically LSTM networks, we propose a model capable of predicting stock price movements post insider trading activities. Our methodology encompasses data pre-processing, feature engineering, and employing technical indicators to enhance model predictions.

## Hypotheses

1. **Positive Hypothesis**: Insider transactions have a significant residual effect on stock prices, creating opportunities for short-term gains.
2. **Null Hypothesis**: No discernible difference in stock price movements in the two-week window following insider transactions.

## Dataset

- **SEC Insider Transactions Data**: January 2006 – December 2023
- **AlphaVantage Intra-Day Time Series Data API**: For querying intra-day price data.
- **Other Financial APIs**: Utilized as needed to circumvent rate limits.

## Methodology

- **Time Series Analysis**: Using LSTM networks to capture the temporal dynamics associated with insider trades.
- **Predictive Model for Trading Signals**: Generating actionable trading signals based on LSTM network forecasts.
- **Decision Support System**: Suggesting the best times to enter or exit positions based on model predictions and risk management strategies.

## Technical Indicators

- Standard Deviation
- Simple Moving Average (SMA)
- Relative Strength Index (RSI)
- Average True Range (ATR)
- Bollinger Bands
- Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)

## Tools and Technologies

- **Apache Spark**: For distributed data processing.
- **PyTorch**: For model development and training, leveraging its distributed training capabilities.
- **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)**: For data storage.

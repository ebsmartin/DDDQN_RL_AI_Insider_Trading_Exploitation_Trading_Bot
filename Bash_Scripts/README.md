# Unzip All Files in Directory Script

## This is used to extract all the SEC historical files in our dataset

This script is used to unzip all `.zip` files in a specified directory.

## How to Use

1. Open the script in a text editor.
2. Modify the `directory` variable at the top of the script to point to the directory containing the zip files you want to unzip.
3. Save and close the script.
4. Run the script in a bash shell.

## Script Explanation

The script works as follows:

1. It changes the current directory to the one specified in the `directory` variable.
2. If the directory change is successful, it loops through all `.zip` files in the directory.
3. For each `.zip` file, it checks if the file exists.
4. If the file exists, it unzips the file. If the file does not exist (i.e., there are no `.zip` files in the directory), it prints a message and breaks the loop.
5. If the directory change is not successful, it prints an error message and exits with a status of 1.

## Requirements

This script requires a bash shell to run and the `unzip` command to be available on your system.
